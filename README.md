# SudokuSolver
Computer Vision & Deep Learning Program to solve Sudoku Puzzles. 

## How It Works: ##
**PART 1:** Process the input Sudoku Puzzle and return a clearer version of the puzzle with OpenCV.<br /> 
**PART 2:** Extract the digits of the Sudoku Puzzle with OpenCV and classify the digits of the puzzle with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Tensorflow.<br /> 
**PART 3:** Solve the Sudoku Puzzle recursively with a backtracking algorithm.<br /> 
**PART 4:** Overlay the solution on the original Sudoku Puzzle with OpenCV.
